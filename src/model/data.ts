With the introduction of biologics and Janus kinase inhibitors (Jakinib), the step management of moderate-to-severe AD is rapidly changing; however, guidelines have yet to provide formal recommendations for how to best incorporate these agents into the treatment plan.  To summarize the updated evidence-based medical treatment for AD, including a proposed position for biologics and Jakinibs in the treatment algorithm.  A literature search of several medical literature data bases for guidelines, position papers, systematic reviews, and clinical trials from 2012 to 2022 on the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD was conducted to prepare this narrative review.  Emollients and topical corticosteroids are the mainstay for treating acute flares and for maintaining chronic control. Second-line topical agents include calcineurin inhibitors, e.g., tacrolimus and pimecrolimus; crisaborole; and ruxolitinib. For acute flares, cyclosporine is preferred over systemic corticosteroids. For chronic treatment, phototherapy should be considered before systemic anti-inflammatory agents. Of the traditional anti-inflammatory agents, cyclosporine is the first-line choice, with methotrexate and azathioprine equal secondary choices. Although abrocitinib may have better efficacy then dupilumab based on indirect comparisons, abrocitinib requires closer monitoring for adverse events. Based on package labeling, Jakinibs, e.g., abrocitinib and upadacitinib, should be used only after failure with other systemic agents, including biologics (e.g., dupilumab and tralokinumab). Biologics and Jakinibs should be considered before the traditional systemic anti-inflammatory agents.  Clinicians should consider a modified step management for AD as they await the development of national and international guideline recommendations for how best to position the biologics and Jakinibs into the AD treatment algorithm.",

Multiple biologic therapies and Janus kinase (JAK)inhibitors have been approved since 2014 to treat AD. These guidelines update the 2014 recommendations for management of AD with phototherapy and systemic therapies. OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based recommendations on the use of phototherapy and systemic therapies for AD in adults. METHODS: A multidisciplinary workgroup conducted a systematic review and applied the GRADE approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and formulating and grading recommendations. RESULTS: The workgroup developed 11 recommendations on the management of AD in adults with phototherapy and systemic agents, including biologics, oral JAK inhibitors, and other immunomodulatory medications. LIMITATIONS: Most randomized controlled trials of phototherapy and systemic therapies for AD are of short duration with subsequent extension studies, limiting comparative long-term efficacy and safety conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: We make strong recommendations for the use of dupilumab, tralokinumab, abrocitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib. We make conditional recommendations in favor of using phototherapy, azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate, and against the use of systemic corticosteroids.",

The diagnosis is made using evaluated clinical criteria. Disease activity and burden are best measured with a composite score, assessing both objective and subjective symptoms, such as SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD). AD management must take into account clinical and pathogenic variabilities, the patient's age and also target flare prevention. Basic therapy includes hydrating and barrier-stabilizing topical treatment universally applied, as well as avoiding specific and unspecific provocation factors. Visible skin lesions are treated with anti-inflammatory topical agents such as corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus), which are preferred in sensitive locations. Topical tacrolimus and some mid-potency corticosteroids are proven agents for proactive therapy, which is defined as the long-term intermittent anti-inflammatory therapy of frequently relapsing skin areas. Systemic anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive treatment is a rapidly changing field requiring monitoring. Oral corticosteroids have a largely unfavourable benefit-risk ratio. The IL-4R-blocker dupilumab is a safe, effective and licensed, but expensive, treatment option with potential ocular side-effects. Other biologicals targeting key pathways in the atopic immune response, as well as different Janus kinase inhibitors, are among emerging treatment options. Dysbalanced microbial colonization and infection may induce disease exacerbation and can justify additional antimicrobial treatment. Systemic antihistamines (H1R-blockers) only have limited effects on AD-related itch and eczema lesions. Adjuvant therapy includes UV irradiation, preferably narrowband UVB or UVA1. Coal tar may be useful for atopic hand and foot eczema. Dietary recommendations should be patient-specific, and elimination diets should only be advised in case of proven food allergy. Allergen-specific immunotherapy to aeroallergens may be useful in selected cases. Psychosomatic counselling is recommended to address stress-induced exacerbations. Efficacy-proven 'Eczema school' educational programmes and therapeutic patient education are recommended for both children and adults.",
